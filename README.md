# chr15q14

This repository contains the snakemake workflow and scripts for the analysis of the GOLGA8A repeat expansion using long read sequencing.

The workflow, `workflow/chr15q14.smk` uses a tab separate file to describe the whole cohort. This file contains sample identifiers and can as such not be publicly shared.
The workflow uses conda environment (from yml files in `envs/`) to install the necessary software and run reproducible analysis.

The workflow starts from aligned cram files (generated by minimap2), and uses [STRdust](https://github.com/wdecoster/STRdust) to genotype the STR(s) of interest. STRdust an operate on remote files (in this case from the 1000 Genomes Project) using a URL rather than a local file. Figures are created as part of the workflow with scripts in `scripts/`. Additional figures are generated using jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/`.
